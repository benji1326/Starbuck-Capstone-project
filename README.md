### Installation <a name="installation"></a>
For running this project, the most important library is Python version of Anaconda Distribution. It installs all necessary packages for analysis and building models. 
 
### Introducing a Dataset <a name="dataset-introduction"></a>
This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.

Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.

### Project Motivation <a name="project-motivation"></a>
Since itâ€™s important to provide customized experience from ordering to offer on loyalty app, the problem becomes to how correctly and precisely locate the target customer group. The objective is to find what are the main features influencing the effectiveness of an offer on the apps and in a second time to find if the provided data can predict whether an user would take upp the offer.
The solution aims to analyze how people make purchasing decisions and how those decisions are influenced by promotional offers. In fact, every individual in the dataset has some hidden attributes that impact their buying patterns and are related to their discernible characteristics. Individuals produce different events, including accepting offers, opening offers, and making buys. 
We notice only three types of offers that can be sent, BOGO, discount and informational. In a BOGO offer, a user needs to spend a certain amount to get a reward equal to that threshold amount. In a discount, a user gains a reward equal to a fraction of the amount spent. In an informational offer, there is no reward, but neither is there a required amount that the user is expected to spend.

### Data Preparation <a name="data-preparation"></a>
There are three datasets provided and each dataset is cleaned and preprocessed for further analysis. The target features for analysis are offer_success, percent_success.

1. Portfolio - renaming id column name to offer_id, one-hot encoding of channels and offer_type columns
2. Profile - profile: renaming id column name to customer_id, replacing age value 118 to nan, creating readable date format in became_member_on column, dropping rows with no gender, income, age data, converting gender values to numeric 0s and 1s, adding start year and start month columns (for further analysis)
3. Transcript - renaming person column name to customer_id, creating separate columns for amount and offer_id from value col, dropping transaction rows whose customer_id is not in profile:customer_id, converting time in hours to time in days, segregating offer and transaction data, finally dropping duplicates if any

### File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions and wrangling process. There are 3 data files used to address the above qustions
1. portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
2. profile.json - demographic data for each customer
3. transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed
